of Paris, France. It has been an especially difficult past few weeks for Ingrid’s family &amp; friends (especially for her two children Mélanie &amp; Lorenzo). Following the release of Clara Rojas &amp; Consuelo Gonzalez de Perdomo in January, four other hostages (Gloria Polanco, Luis Eladio Perez Bonilla, Jorge Eduardo Gechem &amp; Orlando Beltran) were liberated by the FARC on Wednesday the 27th February 2008. News of their release was wonderful and a sign of hope for the other hostages &amp; their families - that a peace process would be possible, leading to further releases - but they brought with them bad news concerning Ingrid. She is being treated very badly by her captors and is extremely ill - suffering from a recurring hepatitis B infection which, if left untreated by doctors; will undoubtedly kill her. Consuelo Gonzalez has described the conditions of captivity; the lack of hygiene in the forest where the hostages are held, the non-existence of doctors and medication. In such conditions, Ingrid has only a limited number of weeks left.\\nPresident Uribe and the Colombian government have decided to turn their backs on a possible peace process by attacking the FARC and killing Raul Reyes and another senior member of the group. Reyes was negotiating with Ecuadorian, Venezuelan &amp; French officials with the aim of releasing a further 19 hostages this month, including Ingrid Betancourt. These hopes have just been smashed to pieces at a moment when time is running out fast.\\nUribe was aware of the negotiations and in spite of international calls for the two sides to talk and come to a peaceful settlement, he decided to answer the release of hostages with bullets and arms. The only voice President Uribe listens to at the moment is that of the government of United States of America. If there are U.S. citizens reading this, I ask you to please contact your Governors, Senators and Representatives. Please try and help make a difference. I know it sounds useless and impossible, but Ingrid hasn’t got much time left. If we all try and act to make a difference, it can be done. I would like to encourage everyone, no-matter where you are, to spread the word and try to get in touch with those who have enough influence to make that difference.\\nIf you are a Senator, Representative, politician, an official or adviser, (not highly likely I know, but…), then I ask you to try for a moment and imagine this was happening to you or someone you know. Really, try to imagine for a moment that your political combat for freedom and justice resulted in you being held for years away from your family, that you were seriously ill with little time left – that your children grew to adulthood without you, fought everyday for your liberation so that the world would not forget you and that you may never see them again… imagine for one slight moment – then surely you realise that you must do all you can….\\n\\n\\nI would like to dedicate this day to Ingrid Betancourt &amp; to all the courageous women such as Ingrid, the Nobel Peace Prize winners Shirin Ebadi &amp; Aung San Suu Kyi, and the many other women who are fighting for Liberty &amp; Justice against all odds. These women are our mothers… our sisters… our daughters… our wives… our girlfriends… our best friends.\\n\\nFor news, contacts, ideas of what you can do to make a difference; follow these links:\\n\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.agirpouringrid.com\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">www.agirpouringrid.com</a> (official site, in French)\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.betancourt.info\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">www.betancourt.info</a> (multi-lingual)\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.saveingrid.blogspot.com\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">www.saveingrid.blogspot.com</a> (my blog in support of Ingrid - in English)\\n\\nThank you for taking the time to read this and please do all you can.\\n\\nH de C.\\n\\n\\nSamedi 8 mars 2008 - Journée Internationale de la Femme dédiée à Ingrid Betancourt.\\nMobilisons nous !\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.agirpouringrid.com\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">www.agirpouringrid.com</a>\\n\\n\\nSabado 8 de Marzo 2008 - Día Internacional de la Mujer dedicada à Ingrid Betancourt.\\nReunión en Barcelona, martes 11 de marzo 2008 – delante el consulado de Colombia : Carrer Consell De Cent, 333.

This transition involves biological (i.e. pubertal), social, and psychological changes, though the biological or physiological ones are the easiest to measure objectively.

This overlap is addressed within the study of psychosociology.\\n\\nThe home is an important aspect of adolescent psychology: home environment and family have a substantial impact on the developing minds of teenagers, and these developments may reach a climax during adolescence. For example, abusive parents may lead a child to &quot;poke fun&quot; at other classmates when he/she is seven years old or so, but during adolescence, it may become progressively worse, for example, the child may now be using drugs or becoming intolerably violent among other classmates. If the concepts and theory behind of right or wrong were not established early on in a child's life, the lack of this knowledge may impair a teenager's ability to make beneficial decisions as well as allowing his/her impulses to control his/her decisions.\\n\\nViews of family relationships during adolescence are changing. The old view of family relationships during adolescence put an emphasis on conflict and disengagement and thought storm and stress was normal and even inevitable. However, the new view puts emphasis on transformation or relationships and maintenance of connectedness.\\n\\nMore info: <a href=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence</a>\\n\\n-------------------------------\\n\\n<b>CASTELLANO</b>\\nLa adolescencia es un continuo de la existencia del joven, en donde se realiza la transición entre el infante o niño de edad escolar y el adulto. Esta transición de cuerpo y mente, proviene no solamente de sí mismo, sino que se conjuga con su entorno, el cual es trascendental para que los grandes cambios fisiológicos que se produce en el individuo lo hagan llegar a la edad adulta. La adolescencia es un fenómeno biológico, cultural y social, por lo tanto sus límites no se asocian solamente a características físicas.\\n\\nTodos los individuos, durante el período de la adolescencia, presentan un mayor o menor grado de crisis de desarrollo. Desde el punto de vista práctico, el perfil psicológico es transitorio y cambiante durante la adolescencia y emocionalmente inestable. El desarrollo de su personalidad dependerá en gran medida de la personalidad que se haya estructurado en las etapas preescolar y escolar y de las condiciones sociales, familiares y ambientales que se les ofrezcan. Los cambios y transformaciones que cubre el individuo en esta etapa son considerablemente acusados tanto en la esfera psíquica como en la orgánica.\\n\\nEn las fases más avanzadas, la capacidad de juicio crítico se extiende a sí mismo, de ahí el sentimiento de culpabilidad como característico de la esfera afectiva y por el cual nacen deseos de rectificación por mecanismos de sublimación y racionalización. Las relaciones con el sexo opuesto se hacen más serias, aumenta su capacidad para establecer sus propias metas, disminuyen los conflictos y aumenta su estabilidad emocional, así como la aparición e identificación de patrones o tendencias aberrantes.\\n\\nMás info: <a href=\\\"http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescencia\\\"

For example, abusive parents may lead a child to &quot;poke fun&quot; at other classmates when he/she is seven years old or so, but during adolescence, it may become progressively worse, for example, the child may now be using drugs or becoming intolerably violent among other classmates. If the concepts and theory behind of right or wrong were not established early on in a child's life, the lack of this knowledge may impair a teenager's ability to make beneficial decisions as well as allowing his/her impulses to control his/her decisions.\n\nViews of family relationships during adolescence are changing. The old view of family relationships during adolescence put an emphasis on conflict and disengagement and thought storm and stress was normal and even inevitable. However, the new view puts emphasis on transformation or relationships and maintenance of connectedness.\n\nMore info: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence</a>\n\n-------------------------------\n\n<b>CASTELLANO</b>\nLa adolescencia es un continuo de la existencia del joven, en donde se realiza la transición entre el infante o niño de edad escolar y el adulto. Esta transición de cuerpo y mente, proviene no solamente de sí mismo, sino que se conjuga con su entorno, el cual es trascendental para que los grandes cambios fisiológicos que se produce en el individuo lo hagan llegar a la edad adulta. La adolescencia es un fenómeno biológico, cultural y social, por lo tanto sus límites no se asocian solamente a características físicas.\n\nTodos los individuos, durante el período de la adolescencia, presentan un mayor o menor grado de crisis de desarrollo. Desde el punto de vista práctico, el perfil psicológico es transitorio y cambiante durante la adolescencia y emocionalmente inestable. El desarrollo de su personalidad dependerá en gran medida de la personalidad que se haya estructurado en las etapas preescolar y escolar y de las condiciones sociales, familiares y ambientales que se les ofrezcan. Los cambios y transformaciones que cubre el individuo en esta etapa son considerablemente acusados tanto en la esfera psíquica como en la orgánica.\n\nEn las fases más avanzadas, la capacidad de juicio crítico se extiende a sí mismo, de ahí el sentimiento de culpabilidad como característico de la esfera afectiva y por el cual nacen deseos de rectificación por mecanismos de sublimación y racionalización. Las relaciones con el sexo opuesto se hacen más serias, aumenta su capacidad para establecer sus propias metas, disminuyen los conflictos y aumenta su estabilidad emocional, así como la aparición e identificación de patrones o tendencias aberrantes.\n\nMás info: <a href=\"http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescencia\" rel=\"nofollow\">es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescencia</a>","flickr_license":"3","flickr_user":"52971398@N00","flickr_img_filename":"2915550024.jpg"}},

Me</strong>\\n\\nI grew up in Ottawa and my entire career was in Ottawa as a teacher, department head and principal with the former Ottawa Board of Education. Attached is my resume.\\n\\nI had the privilege of being the principal of Glebe Collegiate from 1979 – 1987. Sometime during 1986 I was enjoying a relaxing time after work with some friends at a popular establishment in “Little Italy”. The conversation got around to my expected transfer from Glebe in the next year or so. Someone said: “I guess we will have to get your picture taken before you go”. This led to a conversation as to how that could be set up in such a way to show that we do things differently at Glebe. “What about getting Karsh to do your portrait” someone said. I think I interjected that it would too expensive, probably not possible to arrange and who would notice? As all the portraits of previous principals to that date were in colour someone piped in that it would be noticed if Mr. Karsh did the portrait in black and white. That got the ball rolling. Brian Doyle (the well known author who was then an English teacher at Glebe) allowed as how a niece (I think a niece not nephew) of Karsh’s had attended Glebe and participated in our annual school shows. He said he would contact Mr. Karsh and see what could be done.\\n\\nMr. Karsh agreed to take my portrait. One of the conditions was that we would have to submit an anecdotal biography of me in advance of him seeing me. Brian prepared this and off I went to my appointment with the great Karsh – I was very nervous!\\n\\nWell Mr. Karsh was very charming and soon put me at ease. We chatted in his living room for about half an hour and then we went into his studio for another half hour or so. Then back to the living room. I asked him how he knew when to release the shutter when he was doing a portrait. I will never forget his answer. He said that he carefully read the biography that had been sent to him and then expanded his knowledge of me as we chatted. Then when he is looking through the lens as soon as he sees the Alan Wotherspoon he has gotten to know he takes the picture.\\n\\nMr. Karsh asked me to return and view the proofs about a week later. Before I left I told him that I had a signed copy of his famous Churchill portrait. He asked me to bring it with me. So the next week I brought it along (as well as a jar of my home made marmalade). He very pleased to see the Churchill photo and remarked that the paper he used in those days was better than many of the papers available to-day. We had a wonderful chat and I met his charming wife. We chose two proofs – one that would be used to hang at the school and another for my family. They are attached – Alan-Karsh001 is the formal school portrait that now hangs in the main entrance at Glebe Collegiate (where my son-in-law is now a vice-principal) and Alan-Karsh002 is the one that hangs in our families’ homes.\\n\\nHaving Mr. Karsh take my portrait was a great privilege and an experience I will never forget.\\n\\nAlan Wotherspoon\\nPeterborough, Ontario\\n\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.festivalkarsh.ca\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">Festival Karsh</a>\\n\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.sciencetech.technomuses.ca\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">Canada Science and Technology Museum / Musée des sciences et de la technologie du Canada</a>\"},\"visibility\":{\"ispublic\":1,\"isfriend\":0,\"isfamily\":0},\"dates\":{\"posted\":\"1228332874\",\"taken\":\"2008-12-03 14:34:34\",\"takengranularity\":\"0\",\"takenunknown\":0,\"lastupdate\":\"1251834005\"},\"views\":\"1274\",\"editability\":{\"cancomment\":0,\"canaddmeta\":0},\"publiceditability\":{\"cancomment\":1,\"canaddmeta\":0},\"usage\":{\"candownload\":1,\"canblog\":0,\"canprint\":0,\"canshare\":1},\"comments\":{\"_content\":\"1\"},\"notes\":{\"note\":[]},\"people\":{\"haspeople\":0},\"tags\":{\"tag\":[{\"id\":\"27598224-3080740886-1812267\",\"author\":\"27630363@N04\",\"authorname\":\"cstm-mstc\",\"raw\":\"yousuf karsh\",\"_content\":\"yousufkarsh\",\"machine_tag\":0},{\"id\":\"27598224-3080740886-32081808\",\"author\":\"27630363@N04\",\"authorname\":\"cstm-mstc\",\"raw\":\"festival karsh\",\"_content\":\"festivalkarsh\",\"machine_tag\":0},{\"id\":\"27598224-3080740886-334446\",\"author\":\"27630363@N04\",\"authorname\":\"cstm-mstc\",\"raw\":\"karsh\",\"_content\":\"karsh\",\"machine_tag\":0},{\"id\":\"27598224-3080740886-9401\",\"author\":\"27630363@N04\",\"authorname\":\"cstm-mstc\",\"raw\":\"exhibit\",\"_content\":\"exhibit\",\"machine_tag\":0},{\"id\":\"27598224-3080740886-32530242\",\"author\":\"27630363@N04\",\"authorname\":\"cstm-mstc\",\"raw\":\"My Karsh\",\"_content\":\"mykarsh\",\"machine_tag\":0},{\"id\":\"27598224-3080740886-27542294\",\"author\":\"27630363@N04\",\"authorname\":\"cstm-mstc\",\"raw\":\"Mon Karsh\",\"_content\":\"monkarsh\",\"machine_tag\":0},{\"id\":\"27598224-3080740886-6132\",\"author\":\"27630363@N04\",\"authorname\":\"cstm-mstc\",\"raw\":\"ottawa\",\"_content\":\"ottawa\",\"machine_tag\":0},{\"id\":\"27598224-3080740886-7254938\",\"author\":\"27630363@N04\",\"authorname\":\"cstm-mstc\",\"raw\":\"canada science and technology museum\",\"_content\":\"canadascienceandtechnologymuseum\",\"machine_tag\":0},{\"id\":\"27598224-3080740886-11415927\",\"author\":\"27630363@N04\",\"authorname\":\"cstm-mstc\",\"raw\":\"portrait gallery of canada\",\"_content\":\"portraitgalleryofcanada\",\"machine_tag\":0},{\"id\":\"27598224-3080740886-31708425\",\"author\":\"27630363@N04\",\"authorname\":\"cstm-mstc\",\"raw\":\"Musée du portrait du Canada\",\"_content\":\"muséeduportraitducanada\",\"machine_tag\":0},{\"id\":\"27598224-3080740886-6862434\",\"author\":\"27630363@N04\",\"authorname\":\"cstm-mstc\",\"raw\":\"Musée des sciences et de la technologie du Canada\",\"_content\":\"muséedessciencesetdelatechnologieducanada\",\"machine_tag\":0},{\"id\":\"27598224-3080740886-1935\",\"author\":\"27630363@N04\",\"authorname\":\"cstm-mstc\",\"raw\":\"photography\",\"_content\":\"photography\",\"machine_tag\":0},{\"id\":\"27598224-3080740886-278\",\"author\":\"27630363@N04\",\"authorname\":\"cstm-mstc\",\"raw\":\"portrait\",\"_content\":\"portrait\",\"machine_tag\":0},{\"id\":\"27598224-3080740886-1355\",\"author\":\"27630363@N04\",\"authorname\":\"cstm-mstc\",\"raw\":\"portraits\",\"_content\":\"portraits\",\"machine_tag\":0},{\"id\":\"27598224-3080740886-293\",\"author\":\"27630363@N04\",\"authorname\":\"cstm-mstc\",\"raw\":\"black and white\",\"_content\":\"blackandwhite\",\"machine_tag\":0},{\"id\":\"27598224-3080740886-4510\",\"author\":\"27630363@N04\",\"authorname\":\"cstm-mstc\",\"raw\":\"noir et blanc\",\"_content\":\"noiretblanc\",\"machine_tag\":0},{\"id\":\"27598224-3080740886-32594810\",\"author\":\"27630363@N04\",\"authorname\":\"cstm-mstc\",\"raw\":\"Alan Wotherspoon\",\"_content\":\"alanwotherspoon\",\"machine_tag\":0}]},\"urls\":{\"url\":[{\"type\":\"photopage\",\"_content\":\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/cstm-mstc/3080740886/\"}]},\"media\":\"photo\"},\"stat\":\"ok\"}","flickr_title":"Alan Wotherspoon","flickr_description":"<strong>Karsh and Me</strong>\n\nI grew up in Ottawa and my entire career was in Ottawa as a teacher, department head and principal with the former Ottawa Board of Education.
